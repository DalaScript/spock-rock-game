# Spock Rock Game | ZTM JS Web Projects Course

**Project 13/20**

**🎮 Spock Rock Game** is an extended version of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game — inspired by *The Big Bang Theory* — now featuring **Lizard** and **Spock** as additional choices. With smooth UI, real-time score tracking, and a celebratory confetti animation when you win, this project is built entirely with Vanilla JS and styled to work across devices.
